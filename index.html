        <h2>Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (<em>Adelges tsugae</em>)</h2>
        
        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Adult Hemlock Woolly Adelgids are tiny (less than 1 mm long) and appear as black or reddish-brown, oval-shaped insects. The most noticeable sign of their presence is the white, woolly masses they produce at the base of hemlock needles.</p>
        
        <h3>Hosts</h3>
        <p>HWA primarily infests Eastern Hemlock (<em>Tsuga canadensis</em>) and Carolina Hemlock (<em>Tsuga caroliniana</em>), both of which are highly susceptible to infestation.</p>
        
        <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>HWA has two generations per year. The overwintering adults begin feeding in fall and continue into spring. In early spring, females lay eggs in woolly masses, which hatch into crawlers. These crawlers disperse to new growth, settle at the base of needles, and begin feeding. The summer generation goes dormant during hot months before resuming activity in fall.</p>
        
        <h3>Damage Signs</h3>
        <p>Infested trees exhibit needle yellowing, premature needle drop, branch dieback, and a thinning canopy. Without intervention, trees can die within 4 to 10 years, especially in stressed environments.</p>
        
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Inspect the undersides of hemlock branches for white, woolly egg sacs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Maintain tree vigor through proper watering, fertilization, and pruning.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> Systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and dinotefuran, offer long-term control when applied to soil or injected into the tree.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduced predatory beetles (<em>Laricobius nigrinus</em> and  <em>Sasajiscymnus tsugae</em>) have shown promise in reducing HWA populations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Considerations</h3>
        <p>Environmental factors, such as cold winter temperatures, can naturally suppress HWA populations. However, in warmer climates or during mild winters, populations can surge, making early detection critical.</p>

    <div id="lanternfly" class="content">
        <h2>Spotted Lanternfly (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>)</h2>
        
        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Spotted Lanternfly adults are approximately 1 inch long and have distinctive gray forewings with black spots and bright red hindwings. Nymphs are black with white spots early in development, turning red before becoming adults.</p>
        
        <h3>Hosts</h3>
        <p>The primary host is the invasive Tree of Heaven (<em>Ailanthus altissima</em>), but Spotted Lanternflies also feed on grapevines, fruit trees (apple, peach), and hardwoods (oak, maple, walnut).</p>
        
        <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>Egg masses are laid in fall on trees, rocks, vehicles, and other smooth surfaces. Eggs hatch in late spring, and nymphs go through four instars before becoming adults in midsummer. Adults feed and mate until the first frost, when they die, leaving only their eggs to overwinter.</p>
        
        <h3>Damage Signs</h3>
        <p>Signs of infestation include egg masses on tree trunks and outdoor surfaces, excessive sap oozing from feeding sites, honeydew accumulation attracting ants and wasps, and black sooty mold covering leaves and bark.</p>
        
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Survey trees and surfaces for egg masses, nymphs, and adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Remove Tree of Heaven to limit preferred host availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> Contact insecticides (bifenthrin) and systemic insecticides (dinotefuran) have shown efficacy in controlling populations.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Research is ongoing into natural enemies like parasitic wasps (*Anastatus orientalis*) for population management.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Considerations</h3>
        <p>SLF spreads easily via human activity, particularly through egg masses on vehicles and outdoor furniture. Quarantine measures and public awareness are crucial in limiting its range.</p>
