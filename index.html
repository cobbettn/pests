        <h2>Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (<em>Adelges tsugae</em>)</h2>
        
        <img src="images/hwa.jpg" width="500"/>        
        
        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Adult Hemlock Woolly Adelgids are tiny (less than 1 mm long) and appear as black or reddish-brown, oval-shaped insects. The most noticeable sign of their presence is the white, woolly masses they produce at the base of hemlock needles.</p>
        <img src="images/hwa_crawler.jpg" width="500"/>
        <h3>Hosts</h3>
        <p>HWA primarily infests Eastern Hemlock (<em>Tsuga canadensis</em>) and Carolina Hemlock (<em>Tsuga caroliniana</em>), both of which are highly susceptible to infestation.</p>
        
        <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>Hemlock woolly adelgids in northeastern North America are all female and reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis. Their life cycle consists of six stages: egg, four nymphal instars, and adult. There are two overlapping generations per year:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The overwintering generation (sistens) is active from early summer through mid-spring, developing slowly and laying eggs in late winter to early spring.</li>
            <li>The spring generation (progrediens) hatches in early spring and matures by mid-summer, with some individuals producing a second round of eggs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eggs are laid in protective white woolly masses and hatch into crawlers that disperse to new growth. As they mature, they settle at the base of needles and begin feeding on stored nutrients, weakening the tree.</p>
        <img src="images/hwa_lifecycle.jpg" width="500"/>

        <h3>Damage Signs</h3>
        <p>Infested trees exhibit needle yellowing, premature needle drop, branch dieback, and a thinning canopy. Without intervention, trees can die within 4 to 10 years, especially in stressed environments.</p>
        
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Inspect the undersides of hemlock branches for white, woolly egg sacs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Maintain tree vigor through proper watering, fertilization, and pruning.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> Systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid (once per year as a soil drench) and dinotefuran (every 4 to 8 weeks during growing season), offer long-term control when applied to soil or injected into the tree.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduced predatory beetles (<em>Laricobius nigrinus</em> and <em>Sasajiscymnus tsugae</em>) have shown promise in reducing HWA populations. Timing is extremely important in this control since predatory beetles are only effective when HWA is actively feeding or breeding which makes them vulnerable.</li>

        <h2>Spotted Lanternfly (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>)</h2>
        <img src="images/slf.jpg" width="500"/>

        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Spotted Lanternfly adults are approximately 1 inch long and have distinctive gray forewings with black spots and bright red hindwings. Nymphs are black with white spots early in development, turning red before becoming adults.</p>
        
        <h3>Hosts</h3>
        <p>The primary host is the invasive Tree of Heaven (<em>Ailanthus altissima</em>), but Spotted Lanternflies also feed on grapevines, fruit trees (apple, peach), and hardwoods (oak, maple, walnut).</p>
        
        <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
        <img src="images/slf-life-cycle_web.png" width="750"/>

        <p>Spotted Lanternflies have one generation per year. They lay eggs in late fall on trees, rocks, vehicles, and other smooth surfaces. Eggs hatch in late spring, and nymphs go through four stages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First to third instars: Black with white spots, highly mobile.</li>
            <li>Adults appear in midsummer, mate, and lay eggs from September through the first frost. The cycle repeats with the eggs overwintering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Damage Signs</h3>
        <img src="images/slf_mold.jpg" width="500"/>
        <p>Signs of infestation include egg masses on tree trunks and outdoor surfaces, excessive sap oozing from feeding sites, honeydew accumulation attracting ants and wasps, and black sooty mold covering leaves and bark.</p>
        
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Survey trees and surfaces for egg masses, nymphs, and adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Remove Tree of Heaven to limit preferred host availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> Contact insecticides (bifenthrin) and systemic insecticides (dinotefuran) have shown efficacy in controlling populations.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Research is ongoing into natural enemies like parasitic wasps (<em>Anastatus orientalis</em>) for population management.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Controls:</strong> Sticky bands around trees, and manually removing egg masses can augment other control methods. Studies have shown that the insects are attracted to vibration and there may be potential to develop traps based on this tendency.</li>
        </ul>
